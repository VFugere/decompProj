#### Abstract

Litter decomposition, a key ecosystem function in low-order streams, can be strongly affected by land use. Recent evidence suggests that additional drivers of decomposition rates could include 'home-field advantages', when litter decomposes faster at nearby than distant sites, and terrestrial herboviroy, whereby leaf inducible defenses triggered by herbivory can slow down subsequent decomposition in streams. To assess the relative importance of these three drivers, we conducted a decomposition experiment in an afrotropical stream system, manipulating land use (farm vs. forest sites), home-field advantage (home vs. away from site of leaf collection), and terrestrial herbivory (using leaves varying in their extent of herbivore damage). We measured decomposition in both fine-mesh and coarse-mesh litter bags to determine whether drivers of decomposition rates were similar for microbial vs. invertebrate-mediated decomposition. We found a weak home field advantage, but only for microbial decomposition in fine-mesh bags. For coarse-mesh bags, land use was the only significant (and a strong) driver of decomposition rate, most likely because invertebrate shredders are absent from farm sites. We conclude that home-field advantages and terrestrial herbivory are not important drivers of litter decomposition rates in afrotropical streams.
