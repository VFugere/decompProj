**Abstract**

Land use can strongly affect litter decomposition, a key ecosystem function in low-order streams. Recent evidence suggests that additional drivers of decomposition rates could include 'home-field advantages', when litter decomposes faster at nearby than distant sites, and terrestrial herbivory, whereby inducible plant defenses and changes in leaf geometry caused by herbivore damage could influence subsequent decomposition in streams. To compare the relative importance of these three drivers, we conducted a decomposition experiment in an afrotropical stream system, manipulating land use (farm vs. forest sites), home-field advantage (home vs. away from site of leaf collection), and terrestrial herbivory (using leaves varying in their extent of herbivore damage). We measured decomposition in both fine-mesh and coarse-mesh litter bags to compare drivers of microbial vs. invertebrate-mediated decomposition. Microbial decomposition in fine-mesh bags was unaffected by experimental treatments. In coarse-mesh bags, land use was the only significant (and a strong) driver of decomposition rate, most likely because invertebrate shredders are absent from farm sites. We conclude that home-field advantages and terrestrial herbivory are unimportant drivers of litter decomposition rates in afrotropical streams, at least relative to a major anthropogenic disturbance such as agricultural land use.

**Intro**

Leaf litter breakdown a key ecosystem function contributing x % of carbon cycling in streams. Natural factors driving rates of litter breakdown include x and x. Anthropogenic disturbances affecting one or several of these physico-chemical and biological parameters thus also influence decomposition rates; for example, agricultural land use often slows down litter breakdown considerably (). This response of litter breakdown to disturbance has led some authors to suggest that litter decomposition should be employed as an indicator of stream integrity ().

Recent experimental evidence has revealed hitherto under-appreciated influences on decomposition rates, namely the spatial variation in terrestrial herbivory and in local adaptation of stream communities to role of intraspecific trait variation in trees.

Herbivore damage could both increase and decrease decomposition rates in streams. On the one hand, inducible defenses and lower nutrient content as tree pulls nut from damaaged laevs could slow down decomp in streams (Jackrel Proc B). On the oter hand, herbivore feeding creates a greater ratio of edge to surface area on the leaf, which could facilitate feeding by some stream decomposers. For example, Jonsson 2002 paper.

These effects have yet to be tested in a variety of stream systems. Moreover, no study has yet quantified the relative importance of these drivers relative to classic natural or anthropogenic drivers. Here we X. reciprocal transplant experiment. Compare effect sizes.

**Methods**

_Study system_

Fieldwork was conducted in and around Kibale National Park, a 795 km2 mid-altitude (1100-1600 m) rainforest located in southwestern Uganda (0°13' – 0°41' N, 30°19' – 30°32' E). We selected one forested and one agricultural (farm) stream from each of two main watersheds draining the park (the Mpanga River and Dura River watersheds, both of which are subwatersheds of the Nile Basin). All sites are located within 3 km of the Makerere University Biological Field Station in the northwestern part of Kibale. The two study streams inside the park have a fully forested and protected watershed. The two study streams outside of the park have a watershed dominated by intensive agriculture of food and cash crops (e.g., bananas, cassava, tea, and coffee), pastures for goats and cows (< 10 animals/ha), and sparse exotic trees planted for timber (pine and eucalyptus trees). All sites are small first-order streams (<1.5 m mean wetted width; < 10 cm mean depth) with a similar geomorphology and hydrology, but they vary in water chemistry and community composition based on land use; these differences have been described extensively elsewhere (**FW BIOL**). Briefly, the two farm sites have a much lower canopy cover than the two forest sites, as well as higher water temperature, higher turbidity, lower specific conductance, lower nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, and a much lower richness and biomass of benthic invertebrates. Invertebrate shredders dominate the composition of forested sites but are largely absent from farm sites (**ecosphere**), leading to slower litter breakdown rates at farm sites.

We delineated a 100-m study reach in each stream to conduct a litterbag experiment (Graça, Bärlocher, & Gessner, 2005). This decomposition experiment focused on the tree species _Neoboutonia macrocalyx_ Pax (Euphorbiaceae), the only species of tree occuring within < 5 m of all four sites. This tree, abundant within the park (**ref**), is kept for shade outside of the park in pastures that are otherwise entirely cleared. N. macrocalyx leaves are readily consumed by both terrestrial herbivores and by macroinvertebrate shredders in streams. Other than _N. macrocalyx_, vegetation in the riparian zone of agricultural sites was composed exclusively of grasses and emergent macrophytes, while the riparian zone of forested sites included a high diversity of trees, shrubs and ferns, with a canopy height generally > 20 m.

_Transplant experiment_

We conducted our decomposition experiment in June-August 2011. Twenty leaves varying in their extent of herbivore damage were collected from 3-5 trees around each stream (total = 80 leaves from 17 trees). Leaves were divided into four fragments by cutting two halves along the main stem, and then folding and cutting each half into two additional fragments. This cutting procedure was used to assess whether a given leaf decomposes faster at its home site vs. at a distant site with different land use. All fragments (n = 320) were individually-marked, pressed in-between two glass plates, and then photographed against a white background and from a constant distance using a digital camera mounted on a tripod. Leaf fragments were then air-dried for 48 hours in a food dehydrator and weighed individually. Air-dried mass was converted to leaching-adjusted ash-free dry mass (REF) using an air-dried to oven-dried mass conversion equation, a leaching correction factor, and a mean ash content calculated for this tree species (REF). Air-dried leaf fragments were randomly assigned to litter bags constructed of 0.5 or 10 mm mesh (fine and coarse-mesh bags, respectively). Decomposition in fine-mesh bags occurs via microbial breakdown only, whereas decomposition in coarse-mesh bags is the product of both microbial and macroinvertebrate-mediated breakdown.

Bags were randomly assigned to arrays of 5 fine-mesh and 5 coarse-mesh bags attached at regular intervals along a 1 m circular metal line. Eight circular arrays were randomly assigned to each study stream, leading to 80 litter bags (40 bags of each mesh type) being deployed at each site. We transplanted leaf fragments across streams (and land use conditions) but always within watersheds. For example, leaves collected at the forest site from the Dura watershed could be deployed at either the Dura forest site (home site) or the Dura farm site ('away' site), but not at sites from the Mpanga watershed. Thus, circular arrays of 10 bags included leaf fragments from the same watershed only. Arrays were anchored to the stream bottom using stones and twist ties. Every 7 days over 28 days, two arrays (20 bags; 10 of each mesh type) were pulled from each site. The litter content of retrieved bags was dried to constant mass for 48 hours at 60 C, weighed, and combusted at 550 C for 4 hours to calculate AFDM of litter remaining in each bag. The proportion of leaf mass that decomposed in the stream is given by: 1-(AFDM after stream exposure / initial AFDM).

_Terrestrial herbivory_

Leaf photographs were used to quantify damage by terrestrial herbivores, defined as the relative area of a leaf consumed prior to leaf collection. The software Image J version 1.46 (available at https://imagej.nih.gov) was used to measure total and consumed leaf area. An outline of the leaf fragment was first traced assuming no herbivore damage (Fig. 1). This selected area was then binarized using the treshold function in Image J, leading to pixels forming part of the leaf being assigned a brightness value of 1 (white) and pixels contained within holes being assigned a brightness value of 0 (black). The % of original (undamaged) leaf area consumed by terrestrial herbivores is given by: black pixels / (black + white pixels). Herbivore damage was calculated at the fragment scale, at the leaf scale (taking the average of the four fragments), and at the tree scale (taking the average of all leaves/fragments from a given tree). We ran all analyses described below at each of these 3 scales; results remained qualitatively similar (i.e. no effects of herbivore damage; see Results section). Thus, we only present results of analyses at the fragment scale, the same scale at which decomposition was measured and reported.

_Statistical analyses_

R version 3.5.0 (R core team, 2018) was used for all analyses. The response variable for all analyses is the proportion of leaf litter that decomposed in the stream, ranging from 0 (no loss of AFDM) to 1 (complete loss of AFDM). We analyzed decomposition data with generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with a beta error distribution and a logit link function. This family of GLMM was chosen given the distribution of our proportion data, which are highly bimodal and bounded between 0 and 1. Proportions were first transformed with the following equation: (p*(n-1)+0.5)/n, where p is the proportion of AFDM lost and n is the total number of samples in the dataset (n = 313, as 7 litter bags were lost over the course of the experiment). This transformation shrinks the distribution of the response variable to [0.005, 0.995], removing 0s and 1s and permitting beta regression, while minimally affecting the shape of the distribution (Smithson & Verkuilen 2006).

Two GLMMs were fitted separately for each type of litter bags (fine vs. coarse mesh), using the R package 'glmmTMB' (Brooks et al. 2017). The first GLMM incorportated the temporal dimension of decomposition and included the following fixed effects: weeks in stream (1-4), stream watershed (Mpanga vs. Dura), area of leaf fragment damaged by herbivore (0-20 %), home vs. away of site of leaf collection (i.e, transplanted or not), stream land use (farm vs. forest), and land use at site of leaf collection (farm vs. forest; note that this is different from stream land use when leaves are transplanted), as well as all two-interactions between weeks and all other fixed effects. These two-way interactions were the parameters of interest in this analysis, as we aimed to determine what factors influenced decomposition over time, not the factors determining AFDM at the beginning of the experiment. The model also included a number of random effects: 'stream site' (4 groups), and 'leaf' (80 groups) nested within 'tree' (17 groups) nested within 'site of leaf collection' (4 groups). Both random intercepts and slopes (for the effect of weeks) were included. Multicollinearity among predictors was checked with variance inflation factors (Zuur 2007), which were all < 2.5. The two continuous variables (weeks and leaf damage) were also re-scaled from 0 to 1 before the analysis, to ensure that all variables had the same scale (including factors). We report the results of this model in Table 1.

The second model focused on the last time point of the experiment, using data from day 28 only, and did not include a time effect. This second model was used because the dynamics of decomposition from day 7 to day 28 are most likely not linear, such that some variables might have a statistically-significant effect only because they affect litter mass loss temporarily at an intermediate time point. The second model included the following fixed effects: herbivore damage, stream watershed, home. vs. away, stream land use, and land use at site of leaf collection. 'Stream site' and 'leaf' nested within 'tree' nested within 'site of leaf collection' were included as random intercepts. This second model effectively asks: by the end of the experiment, which variable predicted how much leaf litter remained in a litter bag? We report the results of this model in Figure 3.
